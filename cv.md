Hello! I am a system administrator and I love my job, but I also enjoy programming. I study and try different directions, I wonder what kind of work I like more. And the RS School provides an opportunity to learn new things, to test myself in practice. My goal is to be a frontend developer HTML5, CSS3б, Python3, JavaScript, Django, Git/Github, SQL/MySQL, Linux
Я еще вначале пути, но работаю с HTML.
